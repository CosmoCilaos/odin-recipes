<h3>What is a delicious Soba ?</h3>
<p>
    Soba is a traditional Japanese noodle dish made from buckwheat flour. These thin noodles are often served chilled with a dipping sauce called tsuyu or in a hot broth. Soba is known for its nutty flavor and smooth texture. It's commonly garnished with ingredients like sliced green onions, grated daikon radish, nori seaweed, or tempura. Soba is enjoyed as a refreshing meal during hot summer days or as a comforting dish in colder weather.</p>
