<h3>What is a delicious Katsudon ?</h3>
<p>
    Katsudon is a popular Japanese dish consisting of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet (tonkatsu) served with a sweet and savory sauce over a bowl of rice. The crispy tonkatsu is typically simmered with onions, egg, and a flavorful broth made from dashi (Japanese stock), soy sauce, and mirin (sweet rice wine). Katsudon is often garnished with sliced green onions and served with a side of pickled ginger. It's loved for its satisfying combination of crispy, tender pork, savory sauce, and fluffy rice, making it a comforting and filling meal option in Japanese cuisine.
